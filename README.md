# Building and Running the Project

After cloning the repository from GitHub use the command `npm install` to install all of the tools and dependencies. 

The command `npm run start` will compile and launch the project in your browser at the location `http://localhost:3000/` with a watcher which will rebuild the project whenever any source file is changed. 

You can use `npm run test` to run Jest unit tests for the project in watch mode.

You can use `npm run build` to create a production build. For more build options take a look at the `package.json` file.
